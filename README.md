Ennuizel is a web-based audio editor based (principally) on
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) by way of
[libav.js](https://bitbucket.org/Yahweasel/libav.js/src). For the time being it
is *strictly* an audio editor—in fact, it can't play audio at all!—but it can
import, export, filter and mix audio in many useful ways.

Ennuizel is licensed under the ISC license. Its dependencies are all liberally
licensed, with the exception of ffmpeg which is under the LGPL.
