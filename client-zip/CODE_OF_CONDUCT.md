# Code of Conduct

_since it's trendy to have one and I do not mind stating the obvious once in a while_

Please use English for all on-topic conversation. As a linguist it hurts to say that, but I don't know a practical alternative.

Hopefully if you're reading this, it's because you intend to contribute to the client-zip library, report some issue with it, or request a feature that you would like to have in it. If that's the case, I'm sure you are already motivated to be nice, helpful and constructive. But, just in case… (or if you're mainly interested in Codes of Conduct)

Since I am, at this point, the main contributor, let me state that I am not easily offended (an understatement)
and I prefer to avoid censorship but I do have a profound dislike for bullshit,
so I'd rather you spend some thought on the relevance and accuracy of whatever you write than on whether
it could possibly piss me off.

I encourage people to contribute regardless of their… whatever, I don't care and neither should you (let me clarify that: I don't care about labels and groups ; I do care about individuals). But please [Read The Fuckin' Manual™](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
And I encourage you to also not take offense easily, be optimistic in your interpretation of others' words,
choose your battles, and be fearlessly reasonable when you do pick one.

Obviouly, what English euphemistically refers to as "language" does not bother me and I don't think it should bother anyone.
I am more interested in [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics):
Why was something written, and why does it matter?

These attitudes are bad for a conversation, don't do them:

* insults ("language" directed at other people)
* logical fallacies ; including in particular, arguing for or against an idea based on who proposed or defends it
* refusing to deconstruct one's expressed viewpoint or argument (make your unspoken assumptions explicit so they can be examined)
* demanding that someone justify a viewpoint they have not expressed or an action they have not taken (instead, ask for clarification on something they have said or done, see where it leads)
* making a factual claim you cannot substantiate (also, use appropriate qualifiers to indicate your confidence level)
* getting attached to ideas (except a few that you choose carefully and certainly none related to software development)

Also, since we're here to advance a piece of code, off-topic chatter had better be short and funny.

That's it, I'm not going to list all possible stupid things to say and all possible places not to do it.
Really, those rules apply everywhere (except the bit about off-topic chatter).

Sincerely,

David Junger a.k.a. "Touffy"
